# Exploring Sales Data in SQL | RFM Analysis in SQL

In this proyect, we explore a sales dataset and generate various analytics and insights from customers' past purchase behavior. We go from analyzing sales revenue to creating a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM technique. We go from basic SQL queries to exploring complex problems using SUB QUERY, CTEs, AGGREGATE, and WINDOW functions. We work on the following skills in this video:
- Importing a file into SQL Server Database
- SQL Aggregate Functions
- SQL Window Functions
- SQL Sub Query
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- SQL XML Path Function



To apply the RFM technique, three variables must be considered: Recency, Frequency, Monetary.

Recency: When was the last time the customer made a purchase?

Frequency: How many times did you make purchases in a given period of time?

Monetary value: How much has the customer spent on purchases made in that period of time?

From there, the customer database is segmented, each variable is given a value from 1 to 5, with 1 being the worst score and 5 being the best.

In this proyect, we explore a sales dataset and generate various analytics and insights from customers' past purchase behavior. We go from analyzing sales revenue to creating a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM technique. We go from basic SQL queries to exploring complex problems using SUB QUERY, CTEs, AGGREGATE, and WINDOW functions. We work on the following skills in this video:
- Importing a file into SQL Server Database
- SQL Aggregate Functions
- SQL Window Functions
- SQL Sub Query
